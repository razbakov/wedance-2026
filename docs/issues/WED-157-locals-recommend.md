**Original title:** Ask locals → recommendations (auto 5-star review) for organizers/venues

## Tension
Newcomers to a city have no way to ask 'who's good here?' and get trusted local picks.

## Driver
Recommendations bootstrap the reviews spine (#1) and the local scene in empty cities (with #2).

## Requirement
- `recommendation_requests` table: citySlug, askerId, question.
- A recommendation names an organizer/venue (+ description) → creates a review with source='recommendation', rating=5, auto-stubbing the target if new.
- City-page 'Ask locals' section: post a question, see questions, respond with a recommendation.
- Abuse guard: signed-in, one recommendation per user per target.

## Response Options
1. Requests table + recommend() that writes into the reviews spine (recommended).
Depends on: #1.
